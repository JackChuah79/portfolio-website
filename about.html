          <h2>Hi! I'm Jack Chuah</h2>
          <p>I am a Principal Civil and Structural Engineer working in the Energy industry for more than 16 years. And so, I get asked all the time why I want to shift away from engineering to become a UX Designer. So, here it goes. Hope it helps some of the people who reached out to me.</p>
          <h3>First, some background about me...</h3>
          <p>Up until 6 months back (End of December 2017), I was sitting in a Starbuck in Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan. I was unsure what I want to do to the next until I found out that someone called a UI/UX/Product/Interaction designer existed. All I knew all the time was that I wanted to be a creative design thinker and problem solver focused on crafting wonderful user-centred experiences to my client and I knew I am doing it all the times. But, I want to do more...</p>
          <p>Over the course of 16 years, I was trained to be a dynamic, self-motivated and results-orientated professional principal level engineer, with genuine commercial acumen, and a wealth of knowledge in onshore and offshore facilities engineering design and detail projects. I have gained a reputation as an approachable, hands-on and decisive project manager, who delivers sensible advice and engineering support to optimise resources, drive stability, ensure compliance, and maximise financial investment. </p>
          <h3>What's the next...</h3>
          <p>Over the last 24 months, I totally understood that several economic, geopolitical, and technological factors have contributed to an oversupply in the oil and gas market. And there are consistent messages across my client in response to these trends - to reduce downtime and operational costs, increase safety, build a talent pipeline to offset the retirement of the experienced workforce as well as to optimize CAPEX strategy. </p>
          <p>These trends and responses all point toward a huge opportunity to introduce digital capabilities to the energy industry. Therefore, I want to take my steps forward, extending my existing skills with UX/UI design, to make my skill set more relevant to the industry need, and allow me to continue my passion in human-interactions design.</p>
          <h3>Finally...</h3>
          <p>I am looking for opportunities in helping you with interactive, creative and innovative projects. Feel free to EMAIL me for collaborations. Just say “Hello” if you drop by here, I am happy to chat with you.</p>
